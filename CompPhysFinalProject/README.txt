This will be the README for the Game of Life project that we are doing for the Computational Physics final project.

The end goal of this project is to explore the possibilities and statistics of cellular automata, first by merely implementing the Game of Life by John Conway, and then working on changing rules and working in 3 dimensions to investigate how the system changes by adding such biases. We expect that we will see extremely different phenomena by manipulating the rules of the game, and perhaps we can explore some stable configurations.
